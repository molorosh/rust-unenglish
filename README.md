### Dev Notes

If you just want to run a single test (and see its console output)

```
#[test]
fn demo() {
    let basic_string = "Hello, World.";
    print!("basic_string {}", basic_string);
    let result = transmogrify("Hello, World!", &UnenglishMode::Japanglish);
    assert_eq!(result, "‰∫ïÂ∑≥„É¨„É¨Âõû, Â±±ÂõûÂ∞∫„É¨Âç†!");
}
```

Then just enter the command

```
cargo test -- --nocapture demo
```
